  Please evaluate the following English text based on CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) using the following four categories. Each category should be scored from 0 to 5, where:

  - 5 = CEFR C2 level
  - 4 = C1
  - 3 = B2
  - 2 = B1
  - 1 = A2
  - 0 = A1 or below

  ### CEFR Categories:

  1. **Content** (p.20–21): Is the content relevant, well-developed, and clearly expressed?
  2. **Communicative Achievement** (p.12–14, 25): Does the text fulfill its communicative purpose with appropriate tone and register?
  3. **Organisation** (p.31): Is the text coherent, logically structured, and well-connected using cohesive devices?
  4. **Language** (p.27–29): Does the learner demonstrate control and variety of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures? Are there errors that hinder understanding?

  After scoring, please:

  - Provide each score (0–5) and corresponding CEFR level per category
  - Calculate the average score across the four categories
  - Map the final CEFR level according to this average:

  | Average Score | CEFR Level |
  |---------------|------------|
  | 4.5–5.0       | C2 |
  | 4.0–4.4       | C1 |
  | 3.0–3.9       | B2 |
  | 2.0–2.9       | B1 |
  | 1.0–1.9       | A2 |
